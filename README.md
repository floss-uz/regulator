# Telegram Rust Nix Template

This is FLOSS community Telegram bot. 


## Development

The project has `shell.nix` which has development environment preconfigured already for you. Just open your
terminal and at the root of this project:

```bash
# Open in bash by default
nix develop

# If you want other shell
nix develop -c $SHELL

# Upon entering development environment for the first
# time, you'll be asked for your development telegram
# bot token, it will be written to .env file for more
# convenient dev env startups. Token is saved at .env
# file at the root of this project. You can change it
# whenever you want!

# After entering development environment, inside the
# env, you can open your editor, so your editor will
# read all $PATH and environmental variables, also
# your terminal inside your editor will adopt all
# variables, so, you can close terminal.

# Neovim
vim .

# VSCode
code .

# Zed Editor
zed .
```

The development environment has whatever you may need already, but feel free to add or remove whatever
inside `flake.nix`.

## Building

Well, there are two ways of building your project. You can either go with classic `cabal build` way, but before that, make sure to enter development environment to have cargo and all rust toolchain available in your PATH, you may do like that:

```bash
# Entering development environment
nix develop -c $SHELL

# Compile the project
cabal build
```

Or, you can build your project via nix which will do all the dirty work for you. Just, in your terminal:

```bash
# Build in nix environment
nix build

```

## Deploying (works only for flake based NixOS)

Deploying this project, telegram bot requires host machine to have its own flake based configuration.

### Activation

In your configuration, add your project repository to `inputs`.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ...

    # Let's imagine name of this project as `regulatorbot`
    regulatorbot.url = "ithub.com:floss-uz/regulator.git";
  };
}
```

## Working productions

There are bunch of telegram bots that are using this template and are deployed to which you may refer as working examples:

## FAQ

### Why not use default.nix for devShell?

There's been cases when I wanted to reproduce totally different behaviors in development environment and
production build. This occurs quite a lot lately for some reason and because of that, I tend to keep
both shell.nix and default.nix to don't mix things up.

### Error when building or entering development environment

If you see something like that in the end:

```
error: hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation '/nix/store/fsrachja0ig5gijrkbpal1b031lzalf0-channel-rust-stable.toml.drv':
  specified: sha256-vMlz0zHduoXtrlu0Kj1jEp71tYFXyymACW8L4jzrzNA=
     got:    sha256-Hn2uaQzRLidAWpfmRwSRdImifGUCAb9HeAqTYFXWeQk=
```

Just know that something in that version of rustup changed or sha is outdated, so, just copy whatever
shown in `got` and place that in both `default.nix` and `shell.nix` at:

```
  # Rust Toolchain via fenix
  toolchain = fenix.packages.${pkgs.system}.fromToolchainFile {
    file = ./rust-toolchain.toml;

    # Bla bla bla bla bla, bla bla bla.
    #                     REPLACE THIS LONG THING!
    sha256 = "sha256-Hn2uaQzRLidAWpfmRwSRdImifGUCAb9HeAqTYFXWeQk=";
  };
```
